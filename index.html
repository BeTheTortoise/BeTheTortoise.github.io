                    <p>
                      This program began as a simple Python application which generated a random fantasy football schedule given a number of teams, a number of divisions, and a number of playoff teams. The goal is to have that function available on a website for anyone to use. Future plans include using either React or Angular to display the schedule dynamically as it is created and modifying the creation algorithm and backend structure.

                    <p>Space app was conceived as a calendar for celestial events. It will fetch information on the location of a space object and if it is visible based on the user's location, it will create an event for that user and space object, which will then be displayed on a calendar. Determining visibility of an object in the night sky is easier said than done, but continue to check the GitHub for progress or contribute!</p>

                    <p>Scorecard is a simple React app designed to replace a paper and pencil scorecard for a golfer. The app was built to practice with React, Redux, and React-Router. Future plans include integrating it with the Tee Times app as well as developing a whole line of scorecard apps for different sports.</p>

                    <p>Tee Times was created as a capstone project by Evan Procter and Collin Argo for their DigitalCrafts cohort. The app is a tee time reservation app for country clubs and their members. It was built using a MERN stack and allows users to set and modify or remove tee times as well as make friends with other users and upload profile photos. Future plans are to expand the reservations to include other events like dinner or tennis courts and implement messaging between users.</p>
